# -TCC-V6.1-Quantum-Coherence-Equilibrium-Kernel
TCC‑V6.1 is a three‑qubit quantum circuit that takes a smooth exponential decay model and encodes it as a phase rotation.   The rotation is then shared through entanglement, creating a small but coherent quantum kernel.   The design is inspired by Jason Padgett’s idea that geometric patterns can be perceived before they are written as mathematics.
